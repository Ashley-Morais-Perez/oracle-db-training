## Section 9-1 ##
1) a:T b:T, c:T, d:T, e:F
2)
  - a: The WHERE clause is used to include or exclude groups. You could rewrite it as salary<1600 but not ask to count the average salary
  - b: Missing the GROUP BY function, which should contain the cd_number column
  - c: WHERE and HAVING should be flipped. The WHERE clause should have the exclusion of <50 and the HAVING can have the song increments
  - d: The GROUP BY and SELECT functions need to have the same column. In this case, loc_type only appears in the SELECT but not the GROUP BY
  
3) Removing DISTINCT also produces the song_id 49
4) a:T b:F c: T

6) I couldn't use Job History since that table did not have a salary column. Instead I used F-Staffs
