1) When entering them as three separate words using the CONTACT and FROM DUAL functions, it prompted an 'error' stating that there were an invalid number of arguments.

When only using two separate words 'Oracel' and 'Internet', the command seemed to work <img width="331" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51f7f494-0e28-4774-b62e-d93d3ff774ab">

11) No data was found for the department's table? Which is odd since there is data in that table. When I tried using the ':', it considered the variable name to be invalid

12) The same issue as above, the results indicated 'no data' when using quotations and 'invalid' when using the ':'

Since the syntax provided on the slides was for a table, and the question only asked to determine odd/even, I used ChatGPT to help with the syntax format. 

To see how the syntax could be used in a table, I tried to find an employee's salary from the table to see if their salary was odd/even. Their salary was found '0' or even

1- Since I couldn't find a DJ table, I used the employees table instead. I found an employee who's month's between their hiring date and today are greater than 300 months.

For the remainder of the questions, I practiced using the syntax shown in the slides. While trying to work out some of the problems, I kept running into 'no data' or 'error' messages and wanted to make sure that I was writing the correct syntax.
